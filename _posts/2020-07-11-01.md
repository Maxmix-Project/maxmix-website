## Release 0.10.3

Some users reported the firmware installer not working with arduinos using the new bootloader.<br />
This release adds an option to the firmware installer to select between the old and new bootloader.

Go download it [Release 0.10.3](https://github.com/t3knomanzer/maxmix-software/releases/download/0.10.3/Maxmix.0.10.3.msi) or let the auto-updater take care of it for you next time you launch the application.
